# honey-dipper-[your-dipper-name]

Template for developing a Honey dipper. This is just a suggested structure for quickly developing dippers according to certain conventions, or opinions, required by the framework.

Comes with all the dev env scripts for running tests, building the ES6 goodyness, etc.

### Making It Your Own

Once you checkout the repo, merge it in from a remote, download the ZIP - whatever - there are few small things you need to change.

###### 1. `./package.json`

Change the name to whatever your dipper is going to be called. Remember it needs to starts with `honey-dipper-`. Change anything else that is relevant to you (repo links etc).

###### 2. `./webpack.config.js`

All you need to do here is change the name of the dipper.
