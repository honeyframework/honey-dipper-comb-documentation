# honey-dipper-template

Template for a developing a Honey dipper. This is just a suggested structure for quickly developing dippers according to certain conventions, or opinions, required by the framework.

### Making It Your Own

Once you checkout the repo, merge it in from a remote, download the ZIP - whatever, there are few small things you need to change.

###### `./package.json`

Change the name to whatever your dipper is going to be called. Remember it needs to starts with `honey-dipper-`. Change anything else that is relevant to you (repo links etc).

###### `./webpack.config.js`

All you need to do here is change the name of the dipper.
